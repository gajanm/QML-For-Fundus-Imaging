# Code for "Reproducibility Report: Quantum Machine Learning Methods in Fundus Analysis â€“ A Benchmark Study"

This study aims to evaluate the performance of various quantum machine learning algorithms compared to classical machine learning algorithms for the detection of glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Four different quantum machine learning algorithms (Hybrid Quantum-Classical ResNet-18, Hybrid Quantum Neural Network-Parallel, Quantum Support Vector Machines, and Quantum K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithms) were tested alongside their classical counterparts (Classical ResNet-18, Classical Convolutional Neural Network, Classical Support Vector Machines, and Classical K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithms) were tested on six different fundus datasets: APTOS (Diabetic Retinopathy), IDRID (Diabetic Retinopathy), MESSIDOR (Diabetic Retinopathy, G1020 (Glaucoma), GlaucomaFundus (Glaucoma), and PAPILA (Glaucoma). This open-source benchmark with reproducible scripts is the first-of-its-kind in opthalmic AI and is crucial for the reliable development of novel quantum machine learning techniques for medical diagnosis.

This repository contains the code and resources for the project described above at the Harvard Opthalmology-AI Lab (supervised by Dr. Mohammad Eslami, Dr. Saber Kazeminasab, and Dr. Tobias Elze).
