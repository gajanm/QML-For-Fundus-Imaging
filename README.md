# QuantumMachineLearning-Benchmark

Official repo for "Reproducibility Report: Quantum Machine Learning Methods in Fundus Analysis â€“ A Benchmark Study."

Please contact gajanmohanraj@gmail.com or mohammad_eslami@meei.harvard.edu for any questions or concerns.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks compared to classical convolutional networks for the detection of glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. This benchmark is crucial for the development of novel quantum machine learning techniques for medical diagnosis, specifically for fundus diseases.

The repo contains six separate files with the code and results for six different fundus datasets: APTOS, G1020, GlaucomaFundus, IDRID, MESSIDOR, and PAPILA.
