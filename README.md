# Quantum Machine Learning Benchmark

## Reproducibility Report: Quantum Machine Learning Methods in Fundus Analysis â€“ A Benchmark Study.
Authors: Gajan Mohan Raj

Supervisors: Dr. Mohammad Eslami, Dr. Saber Kazeminisab, Dr. Tobias Elze

**Abstract:** PASTE ABSTRACT

## Repository Information
This repository aims to evaluate the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks compared to classical convolutional networks for the detection of glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. This benchmark is crucial for the development of novel quantum machine learning techniques for medical diagnosis, specifically for fundus diseases.

There are six notebooks with results for six different fundus datasets: APTOS, G1020, GlaucomaFundus, IDRID, MESSIDOR, and PAPILA. Each notebook presents the reproducible procedure that we followed in comparing the performance of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Networks and Classical Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Dataset Information

|    Dataset    |      Description     |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [APTOS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/162YPf4OhMVxj9TrQH0GnJv0n7z7gJWpj/view)  | The APTOS dataset is a diabetic-retinopathy dataset with 3662 fundus images. The dataset was produced in France and is labeled with five-category classification (no diabetic retinopathy, mild diabetic retinopathy, moderate diabetic retinopathy, severe diabetic retinopathy, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy).  |
| [MESSIDOR2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vOLBUK9xdzNV8eVkRjVdNrRwhPfaOmda/view)  | The MESSIDOR dataset is a diabetic-retinopathy dataset with 1544 fundus images. The dataset was produced in France and is labeled with five-category classification (no diabetic retinopathy, mild diabetic retinopathy, moderate diabetic retinopathy, severe diabetic retinopathy, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy).  |
| [IDRID](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c6zexA705z-ANEBNXJOBsk6uCvRnzmr3/view)  | The IDRID dataset is a diabetic-retinopathy dataset with 516 fundus images. The dataset was produced in India and is labeled with five-category classification (no diabetic retinopathy, mild diabetic retinopathy, moderate diabetic retinopathy, severe diabetic retinopathy, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy). |
| [PAPILA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JltYs7WRWEU0yyki1CQw5-10HEbqCMBE/view)  | The PAPILA dataset is a glaucoma-focused dataset with 89 full fundus images. The dataset was produced in Spain and is labeled with three-category classification (non-glaucoma, early glaucoma, and advanced glaucoma). |
| [Glaucoma_Fundus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18vSazOYDsUGdZ64gGkTg3E6jiNtcrUrI/view)  | The GlaucomaFundus dataset is a glaucoma-focused dataset with 1544 fundus images. The dataset was produced in South Korea and is labeled with three-category classification (Non-Glaucoma, Early Glaucoma, and Glaucoma). |
| [G1020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oVKiUo9hqUwbjOf_35BS89R2-gmDcGRJ/view)  | The G1020 dataset is a glaucoma-focused dataset with 1020 fundus images. The dataset was produced in Germany and is labeled with binary classification (Non-Glaucoma and Glaucoma). |
